THE YEAR – 1966.<br>
THE MAN – Mr.Abdul Rahim from Malaysia.<br>
THE PLACE – A small restaurant housed in one of the alleys of historic Shivajinagar, Bangalore.<br>

This is where we began…<br>

Back in 1966, Mr. Abdul Rahim Haji, armed with a strong background in the catering business, came to India from Malaysia. He opened the first Empire Restaurant in a small alley in Shivajinagar, Bangalore, which humbly served healthy & authentic recipes, alongside the newspaper and early morning banter. His eager customers just came by for a hot, steaming cuppa chai, or even ‘Haji’s Kappa and Mutton’ for breakfast! Here was a man with not only a passion for food but also a keen business sense.
